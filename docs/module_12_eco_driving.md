## Block Heater

- What is a Block Heater?

A block heater is an electrical device that **preheats the engine** of a car, specifically the engine block and its components. By keeping the engine warm, it ensures the oil remains fluid enough to lubricate the engine during startup, even in extremely cold temperatures.

- Why Use a Block Heater in Québec?

Cold Winters: Québec experiences harsh winters with temperatures often dropping below -20°C (-4°F), which can thicken engine oil and make it harder for your car to start.

**Reduce Wear and Tear**: Starting a cold engine puts stress on its components. A block heater minimizes this stress, extending the engine's lifespan.

Better Fuel Efficiency: A preheated engine reaches optimal running temperature faster, reducing fuel consumption during the warm-up period.

Lower Emissions: Cold engines produce more pollutants; a block heater helps reduce emissions.
