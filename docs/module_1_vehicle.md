## Seat Belt

### What the Law Requires About Seat Belt

- **Everyone must wear a seat belt inside a vehicle**: Consequence of the offence will be 3 demerit points and a fine of $200 to $300.

- **Children must be secured in a child safety seat until they are at least 145cm tall or nine years old**: Consequence of the offence will be 3 demerit points and a fine of $80 to $100.


### What the Law Prohibits About Seat Belt

- **It is illegal to drive a vehicle with a passenger under the age of 16 who is not wearing a seat belt**: If you are driving, you are also responsible for making sure that passengers under age 16 are wearing their seat belts properly.


## Questions and Knowledge

The first block is about the hardware of cars like seat belts, windshield and tires etc., and how we should maintain them.

### Question 1

Which foot is used to apply the brakes?

- **Answer**: the right foot. 

- **Explanation**: In Quebec, the law does not specifically mandate which foot to use for braking or accelerating while driving a car. However, standard driving practices taught in driving schools and widely accepted worldwide recommend the following for vehicles with automatic transmissions:

Right foot: Used for both the accelerator (gas pedal) and the brake.

Left foot: Reserved for the clutch in manual transmission vehicles. In automatic cars, the left foot is typically not used.

### Question 2

Is it appropriate to keep your foot on the clutch while you are driving?

- **Answer**: no.

- **Explanation**: In Quebec, as in most places with manual transmission vehicles, it is **not recommended** to keep your foot on the clutch while driving unless it is absolutely necessary, such as when shifting gears. This practice is known as "riding the clutch" and can lead to unnecessary wear and tear on the clutch mechanism, potentially shortening its lifespan.

The best practice is to:

Keep your foot off the clutch when you're not shifting gears.

Press the clutch only when you need to change gears or when coming to a stop (to disengage the engine from the transmission).

If your car is automatic, you do not need to use a clutch at all.

### Question 3

An underinflated tire:

- **Choose from**: 

A. might overheat and blow

B. has better traction

C. wears prematurely in the center

- **Answer**: A

- **Explanation**: In Quebec, as in other regions, an underinflated tire poses a safety risk because it may overheat and blow out due to several reasons:

Increased Rolling Resistance: When a tire is underinflated, it has **more contact** with the road because the tire is not fully inflated. This increases the rolling resistance, which means the tire has to **work harder** to move the vehicle, which can result in **more fuel consumption**.  This causes **more friction**, leading to excess heat buildup in the tire. 

Heat Accumulation: Underinflated tires don't have enough air pressure to maintain their shape. 

Decreased Durability: With the extra heat and friction, the tire's rubber and internal components (such as belts and cords) may weaken, causing the tire to lose its structural integrity. 

Impact on Tread Wear: Underinflated tires also wear unevenly, often leading to premature wear on the **outer edges** of the tread, further compromising their performance and safety.


Therefore, vehicle owners are responsible for maintaining proper tire pressure for safety and performance. 


### Question 4

In the situation illustrated, the greatest risk is:

Zone 1: broken windshield

Zone 2: seat belt across co-pilot's chest and shoulder

Zone 3: seat belt across driver's chest and shoulders

- **Choose from**: 

A. in zone 2

B. in zone 1

C. in zone 3

- **Answer**: B

- **Explanation**: 

Broken windshield: A broken windshield can be a serious hazard in the event of a collision. If the windshield shatters, glass shards can cause injuries to the driver and passengers, especially if they are not wearing proper seat belts or other protective measures. 

Additionally, the windshield is critical for providing structural integrity to the vehicle's cabin, and damage to it may impair the driver’s ability to see the road clearly, increasing the risk of further accidents. 

In Quebec, proper maintenance of windshields and vehicle safety features is required by law to ensure safety.

For the Driver and Front Passenger:

Lap Belt: The lap portion of the seatbelt should fit across your hips, low and snug, touching the top of your thighs. It should not be positioned across your abdomen, as this can cause internal injuries in the event of an accident.

Shoulder Belt: The shoulder strap should lie **across your chest and shoulder**, not cutting into your neck or face. The strap should not fall off your shoulder or go behind your back. The shoulder belt should be snug against your body and should never be twisted.

### Question 5

One of your vehicle's tires is underinflated. Which of the following statements are true?
1- The tire may overheat.
2- The tire may blow and you may lose control.
3- This may extend the tire's life a little.
4- Fuel consumption may increase.


- **Choose from**: 

A. 1, 2

B. 2, 3

C. 1, 2, 3

D. 1, 2, 4



- **Answer**: D

- **Explanation**: 

In Quebec, as in other regions, an underinflated tire poses a safety risk because it may **overheat** and **blow out** due to several reasons:

Increased Rolling Resistance: When a tire is underinflated, it has **more contact** with the road because the tire is not fully inflated. This increases the rolling resistance, which means the tire has to **work harder** to move the vehicle, which can result in **more fuel consumption**.  This causes **more friction**, leading to excess heat buildup in the tire. 

Heat Accumulation: Underinflated tires don't have enough air pressure to maintain their shape. 

Decreased Durability: With the extra heat and friction, the tire's rubber and internal components (such as belts and cords) may weaken, causing the tire to lose its structural integrity. 

Impact on Tread Wear: Underinflated tires also wear unevenly, often leading to premature wear on the **outer edges** of the tread, further compromising their performance and safety.


Therefore, vehicle owners are responsible for maintaining proper tire pressure for safety and performance. 



### Question 6

Which of the following is a sign that your brakes are working well?


- **Choose from**: 

A. The brake pedal is firm.

B. You hear the scraping noise of metal-to-metal contact

C. There is excessive pedal traval

D. The vehicle pulls to one side when you brake.



- **Answer**: 

- **Explanation**: 

(Driver's Handbook Page 97) Are they noisy? Does your brake pedal respond immediately to
pressure? Can you hear metal surfaces rubbing together? Does your
vehicle pull to the left or right when you brake, or stop slowly even
when you press down hard on the brake pedal?

- Does your brake pedal respond immediately to pressure?

Good sign: If the brake pedal responds immediately and feels firm when pressed, it means the brake system is functioning properly. The hydraulic pressure is working effectively, and your brakes are ready to engage quickly when needed.

Bad Signs (Indicating potential brake issues):

- Are they noisy?

Bad sign: If your brakes make a loud or unusual noise (like squealing, grinding, or scraping), it could indicate worn brake pads, debris caught in the brakes, or even metal-to-metal contact. This requires attention and could lead to further damage.

- Can you hear metal surfaces rubbing together?

Bad sign: Hearing metal rubbing together, such as when the brake pads are worn down to the metal, is a bad sign. It indicates that the brake pads need to be replaced immediately to avoid damaging the brake rotors.

- Does your vehicle pull to the left or right when you brake?

Bad sign: If your vehicle pulls to one side when braking, it may indicate uneven brake wear or issues with the brake system, such as a problem with the brake calipers or suspension. This could be unsafe and should be checked out.

- Does your vehicle stop slowly even when you press down hard on the brake pedal?

Bad sign: If the vehicle stops slowly despite pressing the brake pedal hard, it could indicate low brake fluid, air in the brake lines, or worn-out brake components. This is a bad sign and suggests that the brake system needs immediate attention.

So:

A. The brake pedal is firm: This indicates that the brake system is functioning properly, providing **good hydraulic pressure** to stop the vehicle efficiently. A firm brake pedal means there is no air or fluid leak in the braking system.
The other options are signs that there may be issues with the brakes:

B. You hear the scraping noise of metal-to-metal contact: This suggests that the brake pads are **worn down completely**, and the metal parts are rubbing against each other, which can damage the braking system.

C. There is excessive pedal travel: 

Pedal travel refers to the **distance** the brake pedal moves when you press it. In other words, it is how far the pedal goes down when you apply pressure to the brakes.

Normal pedal travel: In a properly functioning brake system, the brake pedal should feel firm and should not travel too far before the brakes engage.

Excessive pedal travel: If the pedal goes down too far before the brakes engage, it could indicate an issue with the brake system

This can indicate a problem with the brake fluid level or a malfunction in the braking system, such as air in the lines or worn brake pads.

D. The vehicle pulls to one side when you brake: 

This is often a sign of **uneven brake wear** or issues with the brake calipers, which can cause the vehicle to brake unevenly.




### Question 7

You are driving your dog to the veterinarian's. How should the dog be installed?

- **Choose from**: 

A. Have the dog sit in the back seat.

B. Use a safety device designed to restrain your animal.

C. Attach your dog with the seal belt of any seat.

D. Have the dog sit in the front passenger seat.

- **Answer**: B

- **Explanation**: 

In Quebec, just like in many other places, it's important to ensure the safety of both the driver and the pet while driving. Using a safety device specifically designed to restrain your animal, such as a dog seatbelt harness, crate, or carrier, is the safest option. This prevents the dog from distracting the driver, reduces the risk of injury to both the dog and the passengers, and complies with road safety regulations.

Here's why the other options are not ideal:

A. Have the dog sit in the back seat: While this is better than allowing the dog in the front, it doesn't provide sufficient restraint. The dog should be securely fastened to avoid injury or distraction.

C. Attach your dog with the seat belt of any seat: This could be dangerous if the seatbelt is not designed for securing an animal. Standard seatbelts are not suitable for restraining pets, and the dog could get injured in the event of a sudden stop or crash.

D. Have the dog sit in the front passenger seat: This is not recommended, as pets in the front seat can be a serious distraction. In addition, airbags can be dangerous to animals sitting in the front seat, especially in the event of a crash.




### Question 8

Seat belts are mandatory:

- **Choose from**: 

A. for all occupants.

B. unless the vehicle is equipped with air bags.

C. only for passengers aged 16 and over.



- **Answer**: A

- **Explanation**: 

A. for all occupants.

Explanation: In Quebec, seat belts are mandatory for all occupants of the vehicle, regardless of their age or whether the vehicle is equipped with airbags. This law applies to both the driver and all passengers in the front and rear seats. Failing to wear a seatbelt can result in fines and penalties.

B. unless the vehicle is equipped with air bags: This is incorrect. Airbags do not replace the need for seatbelts. They work in conjunction with seatbelts to protect passengers in the event of a collision.

C. only for passengers aged 16 and over: This is also incorrect. Seatbelt laws apply to all passengers, including children. For children, additional safety measures like child safety seats or booster seats may be required based on their age and size.

Thus, A is the correct answer: seat belts are mandatory for all occupants in Quebec.

### Question 1

When should you use your low beams? 

1- On well-lit roads. 

2- When visibility is reduced by rain or snow. 

3- When visibility is reduced by fog. 

4- When you are following a vehicle.


- **Choose from**: 

A. 1, 2, 3, 4

B. 1, 2

C. 2, 3

D. 3, 4


- **Answer**: A

- **Explanation**: 

1. On well-lit roads: This is **correct**. On **well-lit** roads, the recommendation to use low beams on well-lit roads to prevent glare for other drivers: High beams are much brighter and can cause glare for other drivers, especially at night.

**We should use our low beams even during the day to be seen better by other road users.**

2. When visibility is reduced by rain or snow: This is correct. Low beams are ideal in conditions of **rain, snow, or any weather that reduces visibility**. High beams can cause glare and make it harder to see in such conditions.

3. When visibility is reduced by fog: This is correct. Low beams should be used in **foggy conditions** to avoid glare. High beams reflect off the fog and make it even harder to see.

4. When you are following a vehicle: This is correct. When you're following another vehicle, you should use your low beams to **prevent blinding the driver** in front of you with your high beams.

In summary, low beams should be used when driving in **poor visibility conditions** (rain, snow, fog) or when following other vehicles to avoid glare.
